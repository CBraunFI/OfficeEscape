# How to Run Office Escape

## Quick Start

1. **Locate the game files** in the `Office_Escape` folder
2. **Double-click `index.html`** or right-click and select "Open with" your preferred browser
3. **Start playing!**

## Recommended Browsers

- Google Chrome (recommended)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari

## Controls

- **← / →** - Move left/right
- **SPACE or ↑** - Jump
- **↓** - Duck
- **X** - Throw held item

## Game Objective

Reach the EXIT door without being caught by enemies!

## Tips

1. **Pick up items** (coffee mugs, folders) by walking into them
2. **Throw items** at enemies to eliminate them
3. **Time your jumps** carefully - the longer you hold the jump button, the higher you jump
4. **Watch out for the boss** at the end - he moves slowly but has a wide patrol area
5. **If you get caught**, you'll restart from the beginning with a random sarcastic message

## Troubleshooting

**No sound?**
- Make sure your browser volume is up
- Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio - try clicking the page first

**Game not loading?**
- Make sure all files are in the same folder: `index.html`, `game.js`, and `sounds.js`
- Try refreshing the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Check your browser's console for errors (F12)

**Game running slowly?**
- Close other browser tabs
- Try a different browser (Chrome is recommended)

## File Structure

Your game folder should contain:
```
Office_Escape/
├── index.html          ← Open this file!
├── game.js
├── sounds.js
├── Office_Escape_Spec.txt
├── README.md
└── HOW_TO_RUN.md      ← You are here
```

## Have Fun!

Enjoy escaping the office... until tomorrow! 😄
